# Coding Quiz

The coding quiz assessment was designed as a typical coding assessment with a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. In becoming a full-stack web developer, an assessment is sometimes included in the interview process. This project allows you to apply your Javascript fundamental skills in a timed coding quiz that has been dynamically updated with HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.The result is that you can gauge your progress on what you have learned. 

-Created separate files to house each of the HTML, CSS and javascript. 

-Pseudo codes where used to determine what divs, elements, and functions would be required to build quiz assessment. 

-Added bootstrap component to HTML and added divs, ids, and classes to target these within the script.js file.

-Arrays were added to house the questions and answers with a for loop to ensure that the next set of questions were displayed on the screen. 

-Used DOM manipulation

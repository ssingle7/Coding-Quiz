# Coding Quiz

The coding quiz assessment was designed as a typical coding assessment with a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. In becoming a full-stack web developer, an assessment is sometimes included in the interview process. This project allows you to apply your Javascript fundamental skills in a timed coding quiz that has been dynamically updated with HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.The result is that you can gauge your progress on what you have learned. 

-Created variables that would target that values that could inter change the values such as upper or lower case letters, numeric values, and the special characters. 

-Prompts were added to ask the user which variables they would like to have inputted into their random password. 

-Conditional statements were added so if the user chose one prompt over the other they could achieve the same result of a password chosen at random. 

-A for loop was integrated to ensure that any of the intended characters could be selected given the specific criteria. 

-A function was incorporated to ensure the return of a generated password. 

-An addEventListener method was also added to ensure once the user selected the generate password, the user could follow the prompt to yield the outcome of a random password.
